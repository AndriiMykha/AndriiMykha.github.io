After the change of regime, Károli Gáspár University of the Reformed Church in Hungary became a main keeper of Reformed Christian beliefs in colleges. Following this tradition in today's world is both a mission and a challenge. When I became Rector, I made it my main goal to protect, preserve, and promote this tradition.
<br><br>
The word "universitas" means a community where professors, researchers, and students work together to find scientific truths. Understanding these truths is really important to all of them. Doing this requires being very professional and not giving up, especially for Christian believers. This is especially important now, when many people blindly believe in endless progress in technology and society, when communities are getting weaker, when it's hard for local communities to survive, when people try to go beyond what's natural, and when values that used to be important are now questioned.
<br><br>
In this situation, the job of a Christian Reformed university is to make sure that science helps people, not controls them. I believe that the Christian spirit of our university makes our community welcoming and focused on learning and understanding scientific truths. This makes us different from other people and institutions.

<p class="sportparagraph">The university exudes a unique charm, blending modernity with a timeless aesthetic that harks back to its rich heritage. As I stepped onto the campus grounds, I was struck by the seamless integration of old-world elegance and contemporary design. The university boasts an impressive array of specialized study rooms, each tailored to cater to the diverse needs of its students. With five distinct buildings sprawled across the campus, it's evident that the university is a bustling hub of academic activity. Each building serves as a dedicated hub for specific faculties, reflecting the institution's commitment to providing tailored learning environments for its students. From the classic architecture to the state-of-the-art facilities, the university embodies a perfect fusion of tradition and innovation, offering an inspiring setting for academic pursuits.
